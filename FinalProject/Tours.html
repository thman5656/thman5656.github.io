                    <p>Playa Palancar is one of the few beaches on Cozumel with free access. 
                        Located at Kilometer 19.5 on the coastal highway, this beach offers free parking, 
                        a bar/restaurant, lounge chairs and sun umbrellas, changing rooms, bathrooms, an outdoor s
                        hower, massages and three little shacks for souvenir shopping. You can also snorkel right 
                        off the beach or hire a guide to take you out to the reef in a boat. Playa Palancar is not as
                         crowded as some of the other beach clubs which cater to cruise ship passengers. There are always
                          taxis waiting to take you back to the cruise ship docks.
