                    <p>according to <a href="https://www.slrlounge.com/glossary/rule-of-thirds-definition/">Slrloung.com</a> In photography, 
                        the rule of thirds is a type of composition in which an image is divided evenly into thirds, both horizontally and vertically, and
                         the subject of the image is placed at the intersection of those dividing lines, or along one of the lines itself. </p>
                         <p> I think texas road house does a great job of following the rule of thirds</p>

                    <p> you can clearly see that the most important parts of the webpage cover fall on the the imaginary grid lines easily drawing your attention to it</p>

                    <h1>Fitts's equation</h1>
            
                    <p> accorrding to <a href = "https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-glossary-of-human-computer-interaction/fitts-s-law">Internation design foundation</a> fitts's 
                    law is an equation that allows you to desing websites that are easy to use the equation is MT = a + blog2(2AIW)</p>
                    <p>I think that walmart does a great job, However actually calculate if it meet the law.</p>

                    <p> this image shows that all of the buttons and areas that you would click are located in appropriate areas that in my mind meet fitts's law</p>

                    <p>according to <a href="https://webdesignledger.com/the-principle-of-contrast-in-web-design/">webdesignledger.com</a> contrast is Contrast is the difference between two or more elements. 
                    you can use this defference to show how to items are related, or how they are seperate. It also comes into play when you are looking at the overall look and feel of the website</p>
                    <p>I think that discover does a great job</p>

                    <p>I like how the log in buttons are the same collor along with the drop down arrows accross the bottomof the picture it shows that its all realated. but then the pictures at the buttom 
                        of the page really show that they are different and distinct
