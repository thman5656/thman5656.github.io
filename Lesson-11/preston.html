                <h1>Shop Local for the Holiday </h1>
                <p>Local, local, local.

                    Every holiday season there is a push for shoppers to patronize community businesses and seek out locally produced products. At a time that has been especially difficult for small businesses due to the coronavirus pandemic, this message seems even more pertinent.
                    
                    
                    “This year more than any other it is so important for us to support local businesses,” said Cache Valley Visitors Bureau Director Julie Hollist, noting the struggles experienced by many local restaurants and merchants.
                    
                    Hollist and her assistants at the Visitor’s Bureau gift shop in the Historic Cache County Courthouse are some of the valley’s biggest cheerleaders, so they’re always quick to recommend local merchants and products. “It’s fun to give and receive unique gifts, and buying them from local artists and shops guarantees that you will,” Hollist said.
                    
                    Logan Mayor Holly Daines joined the chorus last week with a proclamation declaring Nov. 28 “Small Business Saturday.”
                    
                    “This is something we do every year to recognize our small businesses. They’re such a huge part of our local economy,” Daines said. “So on that Saturday after Thanksgiving when a lot of people are doing holiday shopping, we just encourage our citizens to patronize our local small businesses, those that are owned locally. Shop local, shop small, especially on the 28th.”
                    
                    In keeping with the shop-local theme, The Herald Journal decided to put together a list of 12 Cache Valley gift ideas — one for each day of Christmas, as it were. It’s our hope some of these selections will make just the right gift for that hard-to-buy-for parent, your treasured neighbors, the kids, or even far-away Aunt Alice in New Jersey. (Note: This is by no means a complete list of Cache Valley products or vendors — just a few fun suggestions.)
